## How-to deploy for development

Before setup you need:
* Python
* Python Virtualenv
* Python setup tools
* Libpq-dev
* Git
* Subversion
* Mercurial
* NPM
* This repo (clone, fork, or download)

Setup for Linux:
```shell
cd {{ Directory of this repo }}
. ./activate
sudo npm install -g less
sudo npm install -g yuglify

# For the time being you will need to select option 1 and timezone.now()
python ./manage.py makemigrations
python ./manage.py migrate
git submodule init
git submodule update

# Enter credentials as desired
python manage.py createsuperuser

# Every time you start to develop, start the server
#  It should auto refresh when you change a file
python ./manage.py runserver
```

Setup for Windows

```shell
cd {{ Directory of this repo }}
python virtualenv.py python
python ./python/bin/activate
sudo npm install -g less
sudo npm install -g yuglify
python pip install -r ./libraries.txt.lock
python pip install -r ./libraries-vcs.txt
python pip install -r ./libraries-heroku.txt
npm install -g less

# For the time being you will need to select option 1 and timezone.now()
python ./manage.py makemigrations
python ./manage.py migrate
git submodule init
git submodule update

# Enter credentials as desired
python manage.py createsuperuser

# Every time you start to develop, start the server
#  It should auto refresh when you change a file
python ./manage.py runserver
```

Then you should be able to see the project at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
